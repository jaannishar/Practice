            <p>Resilience is a person’s ability to respond to daily stress. However, it’s not something that can be summarized in a single skill or trait. It is a combination of traits such as flexibility, coordination, strength, optimism, and how quickly you recover. In short, resilience is overcoming change and adaptability in the workplace. </p>
